# 8-bit-vedic-multiplier

Created a Verilog module encapsulating the core logic for multiplying two 8-bit binary numbers. 
The algorithm is employed to break down the multiplication process into simpler steps, involving sub-multiplications, additions, and shifts.
The multiplication is performed using Vedic Mathematics which is proved to consume less power and faster than conventional multipliers.
